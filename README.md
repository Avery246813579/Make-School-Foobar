# Make-School-Foobar
Also known as Make School Problem Solving. This README.md has this
courses synopsis, proposal, structure, competencies and rules. We also
include each of the 12 classes competencies, classwork, and homework.

Each folder has the respected class material and schedule. The
Challenges folder contains challenges students should be completing
every week.

## Synopsis
Google Foobar is a tool that Google uses to recruit their engineers by
giving picked developers questions to answer. At the end of this class
you should have the skills to be able go far in Foobar and and at the
same time excel in whiteboard interviews.

## Structure
This class will meet twice a week. The first week we will go over all
the steps to solve a problem then all the following weeks we go in depth
on one step. We will be working with two Foobar problems the whole class
that we will dissect each week along with having to complete other
questions on the side.

## Proposal
I propose Make School Foobar or Make School Problem Solving will be a
twice a week class named under CS 4: Advanced Problem Solving and be
made a required class. The current CS 4 would be moved to CS 5.

## Competencies:
- Be able to do foobar Foobar
- Excel at whiteboard interviews
- Analyze questions and their parts

## Rules
- Don't read ahead. If you want more to do then do more questions! 
- Authenticity is valued over validity!
- Don't give solutions away!
